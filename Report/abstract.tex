\chapter{Abstract}
% This paper proposes benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of each compentent in the racing pipeline. The benchmark algorithms were chosen to to test new algorthims aginst easily 

The goal of this project is to implement and test a full-stack racing strategy for single vehicle and head-to-head racing, with a focus on integrating and testing pipeline components. The goal is to create benchmark tests to evaluate each pipeline component.

The chapters are as follows:
\section{Chapter 1}
An overview of the theory. This includes all pipeline components as well as current techniques/methods and algorithms used in the pipeline
\section{Chapter 2}
Literature review
\section{Chapter 3}
Testing for perception
\section{Chapter 4}
testing for planning
\section{Chapter 5}
testing for control
\section{Chapter 6}

\section{Chapter 9}
real world testing and results
\section{Chapter 10}

I am a masters engineering student. The goal of this project is to implement and test a full-stack racing strategy for single vehicle and head-to-head racing, with a focus on integrating and testing pipeline components. The goal is to create benchmark tests to evaluate each pipeline component. The pipeline consitis of perception with a lidar, planning and control. Give an overview of the chapters I should include in my thesis
