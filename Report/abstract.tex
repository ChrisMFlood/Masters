\chapter{Abstract}
% This paper proposes benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of each compentent in the racing pipeline. The benchmark algorithms were chosen to to test new algorthims aginst easily 

The goal of this project is to implement and test a full-stack racing strategy for single vehicle and head-to-head racing, with a focus on integrating and testing pipeline components. The goal is to create benchmark tests to evaluate each pipeline component.

The chapters are as follows:
\section{Chapter 1}
An overview of the theory. This includes all pipeline components as well as current techniques/methods and algorithms used in the pipeline
\section{Chapter 2}
Literature review
\section{Chapter 3}
Testing for perception

% Map quaility??
localisation:
maximum number of particles
computational power
sample frequency
response to odometry quaility

accuracy- mean error and max error
laptime/percentage completion
robustness-include noise in input data
\section{Chapter 4}
testing for planning
include inaccuarate localistation data

local:



laptime
\section{Chapter 5}
testing for control

laptime
\section{Chapter 6}
general software tests

frequency of readings
\section{Chapter 7}

\section{Chapter 8}

\section{Chapter 9}
Discussion of results
\section{Chapter 10}
Conclusion
