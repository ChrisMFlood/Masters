\chapter{Abstract}
% This paper proposes benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of each compentent in the racing pipeline. The benchmark algorithms were chosen to to test new algorthims aginst easily 

The goal of this project is to implement and test a full-stack racing strategy for single vehicle and head-to-head racing, with a focus on integrating and testing pipeline components. The goal is modify the current f1 tenth gym to include benchmark tests to evaluate each pipeline component.
