> High precision and low latency localization is a key challenge of autonomous racing (Lingemann et al., 2005). The sensors used for this application are two Novatel GNSS receivers with integrated IMU and two antennas each. One has the two antennas at the left and right sidebox and the other has them at the nose and on top of the main roll hoop.
