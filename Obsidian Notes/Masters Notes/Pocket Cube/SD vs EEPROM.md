The choice for the SD/MMC solution over a memory chip is highly motivated by the presence of an EBI on the AT91SAM3U4E microcontroller. The SD/MMC solution is an integrated flash-based removable memory card with serial and random access capability. Its reliability in terms of security, performance and capacity has proven to be efficient in many handheld devices and its bus interface which can easily be integrated in any design, has been adapted to work with most microcontrollers on the market (SANDISK Corporation, 2003).Â 

EEPROM:

Pros:

Typically more robust in harsh environments such as space due to its solid-state nature.

Low power consumption compared to active storage solutions like SD cards.

No moving parts, making it less susceptible to mechanical failures.

Cons:

Limited storage capacity compared to SD cards.

Typically slower access times compared to SD cards.

Once written, data in EEPROM can only be erased and rewritten a limited number of times before it wears out.

SD Card:

Pros:

Higher storage capacity compared to EEPROM.

Faster data access and transfer speeds.

Can be easily removed and replaced for data retrieval.

Cons:

Contains moving parts (e.g., the locking mechanism) which may introduce reliability concerns in a space environment.

Consumes more power compared to EEPROM.

Susceptible to radiation effects in space, although there are radiation-hardened SD card options available

**EEPROM:**

Pros:

1. Non-volatile memory: Data is retained even when power is turned off, making it suitable for storing critical mission parameters.

2. Typically smaller in physical size compared to SD cards, making it advantageous for space-constrained CubeSat designs.

3. Lower susceptibility to vibration and shock compared to SD cards due to lack of moving parts.

4. Can be more cost-effective for smaller storage requirements.

5. Can be more resistant to extreme temperatures compared to SD cards.

Cons:

1. Limited storage capacity compared to SD cards, which may be insufficient for missions with extensive data storage needs.

2. Slower data transfer speeds compared to SD cards, which may impact real-time data processing capabilities.

3. Limited endurance: EEPROM has a finite number of write-erase cycles, and excessive writing can degrade its lifespan.

4. Limited scalability: Upgrading storage capacity often requires hardware modifications.

5. May require more complex programming and interfacing compared to SD cards.

**SD Card:**

Pros:

1. High storage capacity: SD cards offer significantly larger storage capacities compared to EEPROM, accommodating large volumes of data.

2. Removable and interchangeable: SD cards can be easily replaced or upgraded without requiring significant hardware changes.

3. Faster data transfer speeds: SD cards generally offer faster read/write speeds compared to EEPROM, enhancing data processing efficiency.

4. Widely compatible: SD card interfaces are standard and supported by a wide range of devices, simplifying integration into CubeSat systems.

5. Scalable: SD cards are available in various storage capacities, allowing for flexible scalability based on mission requirements.

Cons:

1. Vulnerability to radiation effects: SD cards may experience data corruption or failure in high-radiation environments, such as outer space.

2. Power consumption: SD cards consume more power than EEPROM, which may be a concern for CubeSats with limited power budgets.

3. Mechanical complexity: SD cards contain moving parts, such as the locking mechanism, which may introduce reliability issues in harsh environments.

4. Limited lifespan: Like EEPROM, SD cards also have a finite number of write cycles, and excessive writing can lead to card failure over time.

5. Higher cost: SD cards tend to be more expensive than EEPROM, especially for higher capacity and radiation-hardened variants.

SD cards require more power

EEPROM:

EEPROM is non-volatile memory, meaning it retains data even when power is removed.

It is typically more robust against radiation and extreme temperatures compared to microSD cards.

EEPROM has limited storage capacity compared to microSD cards.

It generally consumes less power compared to microSD cards.

It's more suitable for storing critical configuration data or small amounts of telemetry data.

MicroSD Card:

MicroSD cards offer significantly higher storage capacity compared to EEPROM.

They are relatively inexpensive and widely available.

MicroSD cards are more susceptible to radiation and environmental factors like extreme temperatures.

They consume more power compared to EEPROM.

They are suitable for storing large amounts of data such as images, sensor readings, or logs.

Considering these factors, here are some scenarios where you might prefer one over the other:

If your CubeSat requires only a small amount of data storage and needs robustness against radiation and extreme temperatures, EEPROM might be a better choice.

If your CubeSat mission requires large data storage capacity and cost-effectiveness is a concern, a microSD card would be more suitable.

If power consumption is a critical factor and you don't need large storage capacity, EEPROM might be preferable.

If you need to store variable or large amounts of telemetry data or imagery, a microSD card would be more appropriate.

Ultimately, the choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your CubeSat mission. It's essential to carefully evaluate these factors to make an informed decision. Additionally, redundancy and error-checking mechanisms should be considered regardless of the storage medium chosen to ensure data integrity throughout the mission.

Recommend combination of both in design especially for long term use of OBC for different missions
